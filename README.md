## Hi there, my name is Dejenae ðŸ‘‹ 
  ## Prounouns: She/Her/Hers
I'm currently attending a mentorship at BAM for the summer of 2025. I have experience with using Python and Java by taking computer science classes at school. I've also used HTML and CSS in APCSA for a coding project; however, my knowledge on those coding languages are limited. I started coding in 3 grade using Scratch and I've continued coding in High School. Even though I've had a lot of experience and exposure to coding, I still have room to grow and plan to utilize the skills I learn at BAM into the real world. 

My hope for the future is to attending a college/university that fits me and my goals. I plan to major in biology with a pre-med track to become a CRNA. Even though I don't want to be a computer scientist, technology is used when dealing with anesthesiology to make the pratice more efficient and accurate. Overall, I'm excited to explore different STEAM fields and build connections with the people around me.
